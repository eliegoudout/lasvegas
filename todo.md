- [x] .LICENSE
- [x] requirements
- [x] README
- [x] Type hinting.
	- [ ] Fix `Callable`s ([discussion](https://github.com/python/typing/discussions/1344)).
	- [ ] `content.py` ndarrays? (`confront` output) (+ in `ui.py`).

- [x] Pypi distribution (`pyproject.toml`)
	- [x] Remove `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Complete `confront` doc with `out` example.
- [ ] Initialize attributes with type hints.
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Add extra documentation (?)
- [ ] Perf
- [ ] Competition mode (w/ copy of `GameEnv`)
- [x] players own/xtr dice property/setter/replace in code
- [x] Think about utilities, in or out of modules? `legal_plays` a method? Could be good.
- [x] Add `ui`
- [x] Continue restructuring.
- [ ] Maybe redo the whole "xtr dice" thing (careful perf)
- [ ] Better internal attributes/methods conventions.
- [x] Better linting.
- [x] Try straightforward get_winners perf.
- [ ] GameEnv : reset/replay on same instance?
- [ ] More consistent asserting behaviour
- [ ] More consistent backquotes.
- [ ] More consistent `'` and `"`.
- [x] `greedy_shy` clean code.
- [x] `GameEnv.__call__`: optional args 'number of steps'...
- [ ] ...and 'until step `step`'.
- [ ] Better `opt_tqdm`.
- [ ] Rethink `roll` structure (natural/dict vs sci)
- [x] Remove roll empty columns `ui`.
- [ ] Roll = list of dicts? THINK
- [ ] If game not initialized, current_player_index undef, care `ui.display_*`.
- [x] Example of policy definition in `README` ?
- [x] Difference learning env/game env in `README`!
- [ ] Restructure (mask sections?) `README`?
- [ ] Weird circular-but-not-really definition of policy/player/game...
- [ ] Add custom rules to `confront` and `play_vs`.
- [x] Ruleset: make `type(bills)` `list | dict`? (same for other applicables)
